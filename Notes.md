## Design Choices and Thoughts

### Design Choices
- **RabbitMQ for Asynchronous Processing**: For its reliability and efficiency in handling message queues.
- **.NET 8 for API Development**: For its modern features, performance, and compatibility with other Microsoft technologies.
- **SQL Server for Data Storage**: For its robustness, scalability, and integration with .NET.
- **Clean Architecture**: Implemented to ensure a clear separation of concerns, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
- **SOLID Principles**: Followed to ensure the code is scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Employed to encapsulate data and behavior, promoting reuse and flexibility.

### Challenges Faced
- **Connection Management**: Ensuring the RabbitMQ connection remains open and available was challenging.
- **Message Serialization**: Handling the serialization and deserialization of complex objects required careful consideration to avoid data loss or corruption.

## Improvements and Suggestions

### Improvements
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling to improve performance and resource management.
- **Caching**: Introduce caching mechanisms to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Enhance monitoring and logging to provide better insights into system performance and potential issues.

### Suggestions for Production Readiness
- **Security Measures**: Implement additional security measures such as encryption, authentication, and authorization to protect sensitive data.
